# Onpoint:sparkles:

##### Automated Points System



#### Description:sparkles:

**"Onpoint"** is an application designed to simplify the assignment and tracking of points to students by teachers. The main goal of this system is to automate the process of awarding additional points to students based on their performance and academic achievements

The system is based on the management of four main tables: **teachers, students, classes, and bonus_points**. These tables store relevant information about teachers, students, classes, and the points assigned to each student.



#### Principal Functions:sparkles:

- <u>**Teacher registration and management:**</u> The system allows teachers to sign up and handle their personal details using the ***teachers*** table.

- **<u>Student registration and management:</u>** Students can be enrolled in the system along with their basic information and the data it is stored in the ***students*** table.

- <u>**Class allocation:**</u> Teachers have the ability to assign students to different classes using the ***classes*** table. Each class is uniquely identified, has a name, and is linked to the corresponding teacher..

- <u>**Point allocation:**</u> Teachers can assign extra points to students using the  ***bonus_points*** table. These points are associated with a specific student and include information such as the amount of points awarded and any accompanying remarks.
